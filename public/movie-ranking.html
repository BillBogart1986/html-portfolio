<h1>The Best Movies According to Bill B</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Close Encounters Of The Third Kind</h3>
<p>I love the science fiction aspect of it. I thought Steven Spealberg did an awesome job writing, 
    directing, and making this movie. It even had a Cameo from J Allen Hynik.</p>
<h3>Jaws</h3>
<p>This movie is the perfect thriller. It has suspense and anticipation and doesn't have too much gore.</p>
<h3>Independence Day</h3>
<p>Another science fiction that I love. It has an aspect of software development which is in 
    my wheel house.</p>
